Shopping Cart Program (C)

A simple menu-driven shopping cart application** written in **C**, designed to demonstrate core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and input handling.

Features:-

-> Menu-driven interface
-> Add multiple items to the cart
-> Enter item price and quantity
-> Automatic bill calculation
-> 10% discount applied on subtotal
-> 18% GST calculated after discount
-> Clean and formatted bill display
-> Console-based (no file saving)
 Billing Logic:-

1. Subtotal = price × quantity (for all items)
2. Discount = 10% of subtotal
3. GST= 18% of (subtotal − discount)
4. Total = (subtotal − discount) + GST

How to Run:-

1. Open the project in Dev-C++
2. Compile the program
3. Run the executable
4. Use the menu to add items and view the bill

 Concepts Used

-> `while` loop
-> `switch-case`
-> Formatted input/output (`scanf`, `printf`)
-> Menu-driven program structure
-> Basic arithmetic operations

Future Improvements:-

-> Display list of added items
-> Reset cart option
-> User-defined discount
-> File-based bill saving (optional)

If you’re learning C, this project is a great starting point for understanding real-world program flow.
